#
# The HDP cluster is deployed on top of the Rocks cluster. The entire deployment
# consists of four stages:
#
# Stage 1: Rocks cluster (outside the BLUEFISH)
#   Normal compute node provisioned by Rocks cluster, possibly with some default
#   components disabled/removed such as SGE.
#
# Stage 2: roles/sw_hdp_ambari
#   Setups Ambari and preping other components such as ambari-agent, disks for 
#   HDFS on all participant compute nodes according to this inventory (or the
#   freelance inventory).
#
# Stage 3-a: Blueprints (outside the BLUEFISH)
#   Final HDP deployment is done via Ambari Blueprints:
#   https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AMBARI/Blueprints
#
# Stage 3-b: freelance + R2D2 (OPTIONAL)
#   Additional HDFS/YARN worker nodes (which are not included in the Blueprints)
#   can be added via freelance inventory which facilitates the override of the
#   target node's inventory groups. Freelance nodes are commissioned to the HDP
#   cluster by R2D2.
